# Traffic Flow Simulation

My first project is a traffic flow simulation that includes multiple cars driving and going through intersections. The speeds 
of the cars are variable and change throughout the simulation. When there is a red light, the cars slow down and when there
is a green light, the cars speed up throught the intersections. This simulation can be used to show that traffic flow can be 
regulated by changing the speeds of the cars as they approach a traffic light. This project is a demonstration of one 
potential application of variable speed used in traffic to regulate the flow. This approach also includes energy savings as
an additional solution other than regulationg the traffic. This project can be useful as a visualization for building other 
simulations that include traffic flow regulation and the code can also be improved by adding more variables to the 
simulation and make it more realistic.

To run the program, the user needs to run the python file and also needs the pygame package for python installed. When the 
program is running, there will be five options, numbers one through five on the keyboard, that can be used to vary the speed 
from one, being the slowest speed, to five, being the fastest speed for the car.
